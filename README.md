## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

### Extenject (Zenject)

Dependency injection in the project is managed with **Extenject (Zenject)**. This allowed for a modular and flexible code structure, making it easier to test and expand game functionality.

### New Unity Input System

I used the **Unity Input System** to provide improved player control.

### Unity Navigation and AI
I used Unity Navigation and AI systems to create simple enemies with various states and routes.

### Universal Render Pipeline (URP)

To enhance performance and visual quality, I implemented the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, optimizing graphics for achieving high-quality lighting and shadows.
